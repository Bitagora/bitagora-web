The User understands and agrees that using the Bitagora Platform is done at the User's own risk and discretion.

### Specific disclaimer

Bitagora and the Bitagora Team disclaims all responsibilities regarding the nature, content and implications of polls conducted with the Bitagora Platform, including all legal and regulatory consequences that may be derived in any jurisdiction from the celebration of such a poll. Users of the Bitagora Platform participate in polls conducted using the Bitagora Platform out of their free will and agree that Bitagora and the Bitagora Team are not responsible for any legal or regulatory liabilities that may be derived from their participation in these polls.

### Indemnification

The user agrees that Bitagora and the Bitagora Team will not be held responsible for any claims, damages, demands or fees arising out of any breach by the user of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or infringements on the rights of any third parties related to your use of Bitagora Platform. The user also agrees to indemnify Bitagora and the Bitagora Team for any and all claims that may arise.

Bitagora and the Bitagora Team agree that the user will not be held responsible for any claims, damages, demands or fees arising out of any breach by Bitagora or the Bitagora Team of this Agreement, the Privacy Policy or infringements on the rights of any third parties related to the use of the Bitagora Platform.

### Acknowledgement of risks

The user acknowledges the following risks to any use the Bitagora Platform and expressly agrees to neither hold Bitagora or the Bitagora Team liable should any of the following risks occur:

#### Risk of regulatory actions in one or more jurisdictions
The Bitagora Platform could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of the Bitagora Platform to continue to operate, or which could impede or limit the ability of a user to use the Bitagora Platform in one way or another.

#### Risk of alternative networks using the Bitagora software
It is possible that alternative Bitagora-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open-source source code and open-source protocol underlying the Bitagora Platform. The Bitagora network may conflict with these alternative Bitagora-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Bitagora Platform.

#### Risk that the Bitagora Platform will not meet the expectations of the User
The User recognizes that the Bitagora Platform is under development and may undergo significant changes in the future. The User acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Bitagora Platform held by the User may not be met upon future releases of new versions of Bitagora Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Bitagora Platform.

#### Risk of security weaknesses in the Bitagora Platform software and architecture
The Bitagora Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Bitagora Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with Bitagora, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Bitagora Platform causing the system to be unstable or unreliable in one or more situations or uses.

#### Risk of weaknesses or exploitable breakthroughs in the field of cryptography
Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to the Bitagora Platform, which could result in vulnerabilities to its network. To the extent possible, the Bitagora Team intends to update the protocol underlying the Bitagora Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.

#### Risk of network attacks
As with other applications based on cryptographic technology, the blockchain underlying the Bitagora Platform is susceptible to attacks. Any successful attack presents a risk to the Bitagora Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of voting transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of poll computations. Despite the efforts of the Bitagora Team, known or novel network attacks may be successful.

#### Risk of temporary network incoherence
We recommend any groups handling large or important polls using the Bitagora Platform to ensure a sufficient number of active Bitagora validator nodes before launching their poll. In case the integrity of the network is at risk due to issues in the clients, we will endeavor to publish patches in a timely fashion to address the issues. We will endeavour to provide solutions within a reasonable waiting period.

#### Force majeure
Bitagora is finally not liable for: unavoidable casualty, delays in delivery of materials, embargoes, government orders, acts of civil or military authorities, lack of energy, any similar unforeseen event that renders performance implausible.

### Acknowledgment, acceptance of all risks and disclaimer of warranties and liabilities

THE USER EXPRESSLY KNOWS AND AGREES THAT THE USER IS USING THE BITAGORA PLATFORM AT THE USER’S SOLE RISK. THE USER REPRESENTS THAT THE USER HAS AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS, USAGES AND INTRICACIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, AND THE BITAGORA PLATFORM IN PARTICULAR. THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO RISKS OF, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE THE BITAGORA PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NEITHER BITAGORA NOR BITAGORA TEAM SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA.
