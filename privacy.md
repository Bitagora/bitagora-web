## Privacy policy

### 1. Personal information
1.	Bitagora is committed to safeguarding the confidentiality and privacy of any private information you provide to the system when registering to vote with the Bitagora platform and software.
2.	This policy applies where Bitagora is acting as the data controller agent with respect to the registration data of polls conducted with the Bitagora system, that is, wherever Bitagora determine the purposes and means of the processing of that registration data. This includes data processed by any Bitagora controlled server as well as by client-based web and mobile voting booths.
3. This policy does not apply to any instance where a third party acts as the data controller agent with respect to the registration data of polls conducted with the Bitagora system or where the platform or the software has been forked or modified to be used under the available license by any third party.
4. Bitagora NEVER collects or saves your personal information anywhere. 
5. During the registration process, the Bitagora server will process your ID number, date of birth, name, and any other data that you might provide when using the Bitagora web or mobile voting booth, in order to produce a unique registration identification number. This number is calculated automatically without any human intervention using a one-way cryptographic hashing algorithm. This algorithm ensures that 
  (a) no other user will ever have the same identification number for a given poll, and
  (b) no-one, not even Bitagora's administrators, will ever be able to retrace your private data based on the identification number obtained.
6. Once calculated, the identification number is automatically sent back to the web or mobile booth processing your registration, together with a cryptographic signature that ensures that it's a genuine identification number that can cast a valid vote in the poll. Once it has been processed, none of your private information is stored or kept in the Bitagora server. 
7. After registering, you will be able to send your vote using Bitagora's web or mobile booth. Only then will your unique identification number obtained at registration be stored on the distributed public ledger where all the votes for the poll are recorded. Although this identification number is accessible to anyone reading the public ledger, with current cryptographic technology, there is no feasible way for humans or machines to recover your private information from this recorded data.
8.	Apart from the information required to obtain the unique identification number at registration, Bitagora does not process or require any other personal data from you for any purpose.
9.	Since Bitagora does not keep in any shape or form your personal data, it cannot disclose it to anyone.
10. Bitagora may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new version on its website.
11. By providing your personal data to Bitagora for registration purposes, you are acknowledging and consenting to this privacy policy.

### 2. Cookies
1. Bitagora website and Bitagora's mobile or web booth applications do not use any cookies.

### 3. Data stored locally
1.	Bitagora's web and mobile booths client-based applications run on your device and use local storage to store information about your registration and ballot.
2. Except for the purpose of registration (see point 1 above), the information stored in your device is not sent to Bitagora's server at any point. Your ballot is directly sent by the booth application to the validator nodes in the network. If the ballot is valid, it will be stored in the distributed ledger. The stored data will not be linked in any way to your registration information, to your IP or to any other data that can identify you personally or allow any third party to trace you using the public ledger.   
3. You can delete the information stored in your device at your will. When you uninstall the web or mobile booth, this information is automatically deleted from your device.
4.	When using the web or mobile booths, blocking local storage will disable the application's functionality.

### 4. Contact
1.	If you have any queries regarding this policy, you can contact Bitagora by email at mail@bitagora.cc.
