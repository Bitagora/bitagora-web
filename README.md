### Confidential
Voters cast their vote anonymously and their identity is protected by cryptography. No private information is stored in servers or made public when voting.

### Reliable
Votes are signed and recorded in a public ledger. They cannot be tampered or modified by anyone. The system ensures that each voter only votes once in any given election.

### Decentralized
The public ledger is fully distributed and managed by validator nodes using a democratic consensus protocol. The protocol ensures that the system is secure and fault tolerant.

### Transparent
Votes registered in the public ledger can be audited and checked by anyone. The final results of an election faithfully reflect the will of voters. And everything at zero cost!
