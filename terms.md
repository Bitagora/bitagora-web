## Terms of service

Bitagora Booth and Bitagora Validator software are provided free of charge.
When you vote or install a validator node using Bitagora, you abide by the following terms and conditions.

The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of the Bitagora open source software platform (“Bitagora Platform”). Prior to any use of the Bitagora Platform, the user confirms to understand and expressly agrees to all of the Terms. All capitalized terms in this agreement will be given the same effect and meaning as in the Terms. The group of developers and other personnel that is now, or will be, involved in the development, promotion or management of the Bitagora Platform is named the “Bitagora Team.” The Platform will be developed by persons and entities who support Bitagora, including both volunteers and developers who are paid by nonprofit entities interested in supporting the Bitagora Platform.

The user acknowledges the following serious risks to any use the Bitagora Platform and expressly agrees to neither hold Bitagora or the Bitagora Team liable should any of the following risks occur:

### Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions
The Bitagora Platform could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of the Bitagora Platform to continue to operate, or which could impede or limit the ability of a user to use the Bitagora Platform in one way or another.

### Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Bitagora Networks
It is possible that alternative Bitagora-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source source code and open source protocol underlying the Bitagora Platform. The Bitagora network may conflict with these alternative Bitagora-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Bitagora Platform.

### Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Bitagora Platform or Distributed Applications
It is possible that the Bitagora Platform will not be used by a sufficiently large number of individuals and organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the organization of polls or elections using the Bitagora Platform. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Bitagora Platform and its potential uses.  It cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.

### Risk that the Bitagora Platform, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of User
The user recognizes that the Bitagora Platform is under development and may undergo significant changes in the future. The user acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Bitagora Platform held by the user may not be met upon future releases of new versions of Bitagora Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Bitagora Platform.

### Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Bitagora Platform Software and Architecture
The Bitagora Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Bitagora Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with Bitagora, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Bitagora Platform causing the system to be unstable or unreliable in one or more situations or uses.

### Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography
Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to the Bitagora Platform, which could result in vulnerabilities to its network. To the extent possible, the Bitagora Team intends to update the protocol underlying the Bitagora Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.

### Risk of Network Attacks
As with other applications based on cryptographic technology, the blockchain used for the Bitagora Platform is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to:

- Double-spend attacks
- Majority mining power attacks,
- Selfish-mining attacks,
- Race condition attacks.

Any successful attacks present a risk to the Bitagora Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of voting transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of poll computations. Despite the efforts of the Bitagora Team, known or novel mining attacks may be successful.

### Risk of Rapid Adoption and Increased Demand
If the Bitagora Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for elections based on the Bitagora Platform could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate that can be handled by the current Bitagora Team. Under such a scenario, interest in the Bitagora Platform may decrease.

### Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power on the Bitagora Platform
If the Bitagora Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and poll computation could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate that can be handled by the current Bitagora Team. Under such a scenario, interest in the Bitagora Platform may decrease.

### Acknowledgment, Acceptance of all Risks and Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities
THE USER EXPRESSLY KNOWS AND AGREES THAT THE USER IS USING THE BITAGORA PLATFORM AT THE USER’S SOLE RISK. THE USER REPRESENTS THAT THE USER HAS AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS, USAGES AND INTRICACIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, AND THE BITAGORA PLATFORM IN PARTICULAR.  THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO RISKS OF, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE THE BITAGORA PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NEITHER BITAGORA NOR BITAGORA TEAM SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO A USER. IN PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY USER OR EXCLUDE INJURY ARISING FROM ANY WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD ON THE PART OF BITAGORA.

### Risk of Temporary Network Incoherence
We recommend any groups handling large or important polls using the Bitagora Platform to ensure a sufficient number of active Bitagora Validator Nodes before launching their poll. In case the integrity of the network is at risk due to issues in the clients, we will endeavor to publish patches in a timely fashion to address the issues. We will endeavour to provide solutions within a reasonable waiting period.

### Force Majeure
Bitagora is finally not liable for:

- Unavoidable casualty
- Delays in delivery of materials
- Embargoes
- Government orders
- Acts of civil or military authorities
- Lack of energy
- Any similar unforeseen event that renders performance implausible.
